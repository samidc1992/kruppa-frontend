# Kruppa

Kruppa is a mobile application that aims to help sports fans find and create sports groups in their city and neighborhood. It allows people to get to know their local community through sports. Currently, no existing app offers this sports group search functionality. Apps such as Strava, Nike Run and Freeletics are limited to tracking sports activities. To solve this problem, Kruppa was developed in an academic setting with the following constraints:  
  1. Limited resources: the entire application was developed in two weeks by three developers. 
  2. Technical Stack:  
    A. Front-end: React Native (with Expo) and Redux  
    B. Back-end: NodeJS, Express and Mongoose
