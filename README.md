# About Kruppa

Kruppa is a mobile application to help sports fans find, join and/or create sport groups in their city and neighborhood. It allows people to gather around sport activities and their community. Kruppa was initially developed in an academic setting to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) collaborating with two other developers in a time restrictive intensive schedule (2 weeks). After delivering the MVP, I continue to develop the application to deepen my knowledge in both NodeJS and React Native.
